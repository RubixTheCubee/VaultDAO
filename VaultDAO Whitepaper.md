## Introduction

VaultDAO leverages Hyperliquid's vault infrastructure to provide users access to complex trading strategies without the need to manage trades themselves. Unlike conventional vaults that merely rebalance assets, Hyperliquid vaults integrate advanced trading capabilities, such as liquidation and high-throughput market making. VaultDAO aims to harness this functionality to offer a transparent, community-managed investment vehicle.

## Problem Statement

Traditional financial products offering passive income are often limited by high fees, exclusive access, and lack of transparency. Investors and general individuals face challenges accessing advanced trading strategies due to either poor knowledge in the Web3 sphere or simply them being inaccessible, VaultDAO addresses these barriers by:

- Opening access to long-term and high-gain strategies on Hyperliquid.
- Providing a decentralized governance structure that allows community members to propose and vote on new strategies.
- Offering transparent performance metrics and risk disclosures, empowering investors to make informed decisions.

## Solution Overview

VaultDAO utilizes Hyperliquid's native vault infrastructure, allowing anyone to deposit and earn a share of profits from the vault's trading strategies. Managed by community-approved strategies, VaultDAO provides a transparent and secure environment for passive income generation.

### Key Features:
- **Community Governance:** All strategies and key decisions are governed by the VaultDAO community, ensuring transparent and inclusive decision-making.
- **Advanced Trading Strategies:** VaultDAO deploys sophisticated and strategically places positions that run on Hyperliquid's high-speed infrastructure.
- **Profit-Sharing Mechanism:** Depositors earn a share of the vault's profits proportionate to their contribution, with a small percentage allocated to maintain the vault and incentivize community participation.

## Architecture and Design

VaultDAO is built on Hyperliquid's Layer 1 infrastructure using their "Vaults" feature, leveraging the platform’s high throughput and secure trading environment. The main components of VaultDAO's architecture include:

- **Smart Contracts:** Govern the vault’s operations, including deposits, withdrawals, strategy deployment, and profit distribution.
- **Hyperliquid Integration:** Utilizes Hyperliquid's built-in support for market-making, liquidation, and other automated trading strategies.
- **Governance Interface:** Allows community members to participate in governance decisions, including strategy proposals, parameter adjustments, and performance reviews.

### Technical Specifications
- **Platform:** Hyperliquid L1
- **Key Integrations:** All standard Hyperliquid tools. 

## Governance Model

VaultDAO is fully community-driven, with governance powered by DAO principles. Key aspects of the governance model include:

- **Proposals:** Community members propose new strategies or modifications to existing operations.
- **Voting:** Each member’s voting power is determined by their stake in the DAO, allowing all contributors to have a say in the direction of the vault.
- **Execution:** Approved proposals are automatically implemented through smart contracts, minimizing manual intervention and ensuring transparency.

## Risk Assessment

VaultDAO’s risk management framework includes:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Ongoing evaluation of strategy performance and risk metrics to ensure alignment with vault objectives.
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Regular third-party audits to identify vulnerabilities and enhance security.
- **Diversification:** Use of multiple strategies to spread risk and enhance overall stability.

## Tokenomics

VaultDAO’s ecosystem operates on a governance token model, providing incentives for participation and ensuring the sustainability of the vault. Key elements include:

- **Distribution:** Tokens are distributed among contributors, governance participants, and strategic partners.
- **Fees:** A small percentage of profits is reinvested into the DAO to fund ongoing operations, community rewards, and strategic developments.

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1:** Launch of VaultDAO on Hyperliquid with initial strategies being temporarily controlled solely by the Leader of the Vault up until a good APY has been amassed. 
2. **Phase 2:** Expansion of governance features and introduction of new income strategies.
3. **Phase 3:** Integration with additional protocols and scaling of liquidity. Possible expansion as its own separate smart contract. 
4. **Phase 4:** Long-term scaling, including cross-chain strategy implementations and broader community engagement.

## Conclusion

VaultDAO represents a new frontier in decentralized passive income opportunities, combining advanced trading strategies with a transparent and community-focused governance model. By leveraging Hyperliquid’s robust infrastructure, VaultDAO democratizes access to complex financial operations, providing a secure and profitable environment for all participants.
